# Terraform Project README

## Configure AWS CLI

To interact with your AWS environment, you'll need to configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Install AWS CLI:**
   - If you haven't already installed AWS CLI, you can download and install it from the official AWS documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

2. **Configure AWS CLI:**
   - Open your terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```
   - You'll be prompted to enter the following information:
     - AWS Access Key ID
     - AWS Secret Access Key
     - Default region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
     - Output format (e.g., `json`)

   - This step ensures that Terraform can authenticate and interact with your AWS account securely.

## Getting Started with Terraform

Now that AWS CLI is configured, you can proceed to set up and manage your infrastructure using Terraform.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the Terraform project repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd <project-directory>
     ```

2. **Replace Variables:**
   - Open the `variables.tf` file in a text editor.
   - Replace the placeholder values with your specific configurations. For example, set `domain_name` to your actual domain and `s3_bucket_name` to the desired name of your S3 bucket.

3. **Create `terraform.tfvars` File:**
   - Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` in the root directory of your project.
   - This file will contain your variable values specific to your environment. For instance:
     ```hcl
     domain_name     = "yourdomain.com"
     s3_bucket_name  = "your-unique-bucket-name"
     ```

4. **Initialize Terraform:**
   - Initialize Terraform in your project directory to download necessary providers and modules:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     ```

5. **Plan Infrastructure Changes:**
   - Generate and review an execution plan for Terraform to understand what actions it will perform:
     ```bash
     terraform plan
     ```
   - This step is crucial for previewing changes before applying them to your environment.

6. **Apply Changes:**
   - Apply the planned changes to create or update your infrastructure:
     ```bash
     terraform apply
     ```
   - Confirm by typing `yes` when prompted. Terraform will execute the actions defined in your configuration files.

7. **Destroy Infrastructure:**
   - When you no longer need your infrastructure, safely tear it down:
     ```bash
     terraform destroy
     ```
   - Confirm by typing `yes` when prompted. This action removes all resources managed by Terraform.

## Additional Notes

- Always review the Terraform plan (`terraform plan`) before applying changes to ensure they align with your expectations.
- Consult the Terraform documentation for advanced configurations and troubleshooting tips.
- For questions or issues specific to this project, refer to the README or reach out to the project maintainers.
